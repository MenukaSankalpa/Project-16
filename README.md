# Project-16
Django CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations allow managing database records through Django models, views, and templates. Create uses POST requests and forms, Read retrieves data via queries, Update modifies existing records with POST, and Delete removes records. All are implemented using Django's ORM and views.
